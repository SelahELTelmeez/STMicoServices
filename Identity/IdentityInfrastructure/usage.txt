* Why not using Repo pattern?

No, the repository/unit-of-work pattern (shortened to Rep/UoW) isn’t useful with EF Core. EF Core already implements a Rep/UoW pattern, so layering another Rep/UoW pattern on top of EF Core isn’t helpful.

A better solution is to use EF Core directly, which allows you to use all of EF Core’s feature to produce high-performing database accesses.
